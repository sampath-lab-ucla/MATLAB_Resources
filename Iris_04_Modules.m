%% Designing A Module
% In this document we will cover how to create a custom user-interface to work with
% data in Iris. 
%%% 
% The main viewer in Iris has a number of available options, from digital filtering
% to rudimentary statistical operations. While some of these features are available
% at data export, there is much more that could be done. This is where modules come
% in. A module allows the user to create a simply user interface either through the
% MATLAB AppDesigner or through a programmatic way.
